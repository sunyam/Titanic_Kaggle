Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

This is a pretty famous competition hosted by Kaggle!
The page on https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic says:
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

In this repository, I'll cover this problem from the very beginning!
I'll initally do some visualisation to analyse the data using some super-useful Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
Once, the main features are identified and we know what the data is about, we'll implement Random Forests using scikit-learn!
Even if you're new to these awesome Python Libraries, the Jupyter IPython notebook will be comprehensive enough for you to learn and understand.
